# Skill Tree Backend

## Required Tools
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (If you're using macOS)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (version 3.9.6 or higher)
- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/#java17) (version 17)
- [IntelliJ Community or Ultimate Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/other.html)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Development Setup
### Install Maven
#### macOS
1. To install maven type the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   brew install maven
   ```
2. Verify your installation using the following command:
   ```bash
   mvn -version
   ```
   If maven is installed correctly you should see the maven version in the terminal:
   ```bash
   Apache Maven 3.9.7
   ```

#### Windows
1. To install Maven on Windows, we head over to the Apache Maven site to download the latest version and select the Maven zip file, for example, apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.zip.
2. Adding Maven to the Environment Path
   We add both M2_HOME and MAVEN_HOME variables to the Windows environment using system properties and point them to our Maven folder.
3. Verify the Maven installation by typing:
   mvn -version
4. Then, we update the PATH variable by appending the Maven bin folder — %M2_HOME%\bin — so that we can run the Maven command everywhere.

### Setup database and configure env
- To setup the database & create a `.env` file run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
  make setup 
  ```
  - To edit your environment variables edit the `.env` file.

#### NOTE: 
- If you do not have `make` installed, run the `docker-run` and  `copy-env` commands from the `Makefile` manually. 

### Install EnvFile Plugin in IntelliJ
- To read the values from your `.env` you will need install the `EnvFile` plugin.
- To Install the plugin to go `settings` > `Plugins` > `Marketplace` > EnvFile.

## Steps to authenticate a user during development
- Run RDS backend on your local machine
- Copy the `public key` from `local.js` (if not in `local.js` copy it from `development.js`) and add it in your `.env` file.
- Run skill tree frontend, click on `signin with github` button
    - Once authenticated you will be redirected to `localhost:4000` (skill tree frontend homepage) and a `rds-session-v2-development` cookie will be set in the browser which will be used for authentication when making API calls.
    - NOTE:
        - make sure that `incompleteUserDetails` is false for the user in firestore, else the redirect will not work as intended.


## To Authenticate Yourself

Using [Website - backend](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/website-backend)
On Local - http://localhost:3000/auth/github/login?redirectURL=https://staging-skilltree.realdevsquad.com/tasks?v2=true
This will create a cookie in your browser `rds-session-v2-development`

On Staging - https://staging-api.realdevsquad.com/auth/github/login?redirectURL=https://staging-skilltree.realdevsquad.com/tasks?v2=true
This will create a cookie in your browser named `rds-session-v2-staging`
